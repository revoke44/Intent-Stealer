2. Put your webhook url in, enable what you want to enable and click build.

3. After it is done building you should find a file named main.exe in the new dist folder.

4. Give that file to people and when they run it their info will get sent to your webhook.

# Security Info

Intent-Stealer flags like a virus just like other stub builders.
The main.exe file it generates is fully undetectable by virus total and most antiviruses.
